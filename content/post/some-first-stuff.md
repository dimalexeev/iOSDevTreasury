It’s been 20 years since Epic Games first released its Unreal game development engine in concert with its first person shooter, Unreal. Since then, the company has been releasing free-to-play games as a loss leader to show off what its powerful development toolkit can do.

Now, with the insane success of Fortnite, the company has flipped the script.

Since Fortnite became the thing that nearly every gamer in the world plays, the company has slashed prices on the Unreal game engine even as it keeps upgrading the technology.

Perhaps even more exciting is news of a MacBook Air successor with a high-res screen. It’s still not clear exactly what we’re in for — whether it’ll be updated parts in the Air’s body, a brand new take on the Air, or just an alternate version of the MacBook. But it’s clear that some kind of much-needed update is coming. Bloomberg says it’ll have a 13-inch screen, which means that at the very least, it’ll be different than today’s MacBook.

Mac Mini fans will also find their immense (and honestly questionable) patience rewarded, as the much-neglected PC will get a spec update for the first time since 2014. Bloomberg says it’ll get new processors and some other features meant for pro users. Updated iMacs and iMac Pros are also in the works, as is a processor bump for the 12-inch MacBook, but it’s not clear if those will all be ready for the event.
